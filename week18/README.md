# Week 18 - Positioning, Display, and More!

Here are all the challenges for this week. Take the code from the `challenge<#>.html` and try to get it to match as closely as possible with the `challenge<#>-res.html` page. 

## Challenge 1

Without changing the order of the elements in the HTML file, change the order that the boxes are displayed. 

## Challenge 2

Change the navbar class so that:

1. The background color is pink.
2. The text "Hello!" is centered.
3. The navbar runs from the left to the right of the page.
4. The navbar remains in the same spot when you scroll.
5. The navbar is 100px tall.

## Challenge 3

Make the green box scroll normally until a certain point, after which it remains in the same place, with an offset of 300px from the top of the page.

## Challenge 4

Without changing any of the HTML (only CSS), make the initial page look like the result page.
