# Week 19 - Dynamic CSS

Here are all the challenges for this week. Take the code from the `challenge<#>.html` and try to get it to match as closely as possible with the `challenge<#>-res.html` page. 

Use CSS as much as possible. The only time you should be modifying the HTML is to add an id or class. The contents
  and layout should never be changed.
